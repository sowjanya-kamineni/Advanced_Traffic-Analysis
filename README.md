## üíª Project Abstract: 
<p>This project, "Traffic Analysis Using Computer Vision " uses AI-powered computer vision techniques to analyze traffic density and categorize vehicles based on their economic status. The system can distinguish between luxury, mid-range, and economy cars while monitoring traffic flow and congestion patterns by incorporating deep learning models such as ResNet and YOLOv8. A business intelligence model is fed the extracted insights, and it uses economic trends and vehicle demographics to recommend the best places for businesses. The system guarantees high accuracy, scalability, and real-time adaptability, empowering entrepreneurs and urban planners to make well-informed investment choices.<p>

### ü´ß Background
<p>Understanding traffic patterns and economic demographics is critical for urban development and business investment. Conventional approaches only count vehicles and don't provide detailed information about consumer spending power or business location suitability. By evaluating traffic patterns and vehicle classifications using computer vision, deep learning, and economic analysis, this project improves decision-making. The system gathers useful data for business intelligence and predictive modeling by analyzing real-time CCTV and drone footage.<p>
